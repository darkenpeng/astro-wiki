#ZIO
foreachPardiscard / foreachDiscard - Die 시

Applies the function f to each element of the Iterable[A] and runs produced effects in parallel, discarding the results.
For a sequential version of this method, see foreachDiscard.
Optimized to avoid keeping full tree of effects, so that method could be able to handle large input sequences. Behaves almost like this code:

as.foldLeft(ZIO.unit) { (acc, a) => acc.zipParLeft(f(a)) }
Additionally, interrupts all effects on any failure.
