**It’s a good way to think about components, but _not_ about Effects.** Instead, try to think about each Effect independently from your component’s lifecycle.

- A component _mounts_ when it’s added to the screen.
- A component _updates_ when it receives new props or state, usually in response to an interaction.
- A component _unmounts_ when it’s removed from the screen.

mount
렌더링되면 마운트되었다라고 표현하는 게 맞는건지?
